# top200-rs Project Overview

I'm working on `top200-rs`, a Rust-based market data tracking system for the top 200 fashion and retail companies. Here are the key documents to help you understand the current state and context:

- Main Documentation: [README.md](README.md) - Core vision, implementation details, and setup instructions
- Data Collection: Daily automated collection of market cap data for fashion/retail companies
- Market Analysis: Support for US, EU, and combined market analysis
- Historical Tracking: End-of-year valuations and market cap history

1. Current Status & Priorities:
   - Database setup and migrations
   - Daily data collection pipeline
   - Market cap calculations
   - Currency conversions
   - Company ticker tracking and updates

2. Technical Specifications:
   - Core Components:
      - SQLite database for data storage
      - Async Rust implementation with Tokio
      - HTTP client for market data fetching
      - Data export functionality for different regions
   - Configuration:
      - Environment variables in `.env`
      - Application settings in `config.toml`
      - Database migrations in `/migrations`

3. Main Implementation Directories:
   - `/src`: Core Rust implementation
   - `/migrations`: Database schema and updates
   - `/data`: Market data storage (SQLite)
   - `/output`: Generated reports and analysis

Based on the project structure and recent updates, here are suggested areas to focus on:

1. Database setup and initial data collection
2. Implementation of market cap calculation logic
3. Setting up automated daily data collection
4. Adding support for additional market regions
5. Implementing data visualization and reporting

The project uses modern Rust tooling with SQLx for database operations, and includes comprehensive CI/CD through GitHub Actions for reliable deployment and testing.
